# Computation of Zeta functions using the Fourier series expansion and the modularity of Eisenstein series

The programs of this repository are the algorithm implementations using a strategy proposed by Pierre Colmez and developed by @hugochap and me. There is a first folder with a program that can compute the values of the Riemann zeta function and a second with programs that compute approximations of Stark numbers associated to lattice zeta functions.
