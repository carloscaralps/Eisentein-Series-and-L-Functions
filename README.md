# Computation of Zeta functions using the Fourier series expansion and the modularity of Eisenstein series

The programs of this repository are the implementation of the algorithm proposed by Pierre Colmez and developed by @hugochap and me. There is a first folder with a program that is able to compute the values of the Riemann zeta function and a second with programs that compute approximations of Stark numbers associated to lattice zeta functions.
